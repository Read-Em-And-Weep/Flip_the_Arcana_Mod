# The Problem
We've only got 25 arcana cards to use, meaning only around 500,000 combinations if you had unlimited grasp. We're practically so limited in options :(


# The Solution
Every card can now be flipped into a whole new card with new upgrades to unlock! This explodes the possible number of combinations you can try, with them being designed for different synergies, uses and builds. Unlock the full power of your arcana with familiar faces, ranging from Hypnos, to Dusa, to Typhon, your familiars and even Lernie the Bone Hydra!

# How do I access the new arcana?
After unlocking every familiar and gaining the ability to upgrade your arcana, you will learn a new incantation. This will enable you to flip cards. After you do perform the incantation in the Cauldron, use the same button you use to pin things (or your reroll button, if that's preferable - particularly for controller users) to flip your cards (which will have the side effect of also pinning whatever card you are clicking).

# Compatibility
If you have Zagreus's Journey installed (Hades 1 run), the cards will require resources from that route in order to unlock and upgrade, giving you a real reason to take that route. 

In addition, if Extended Altar of Ashes is installed, you will get additional levels for these cards! 

# Uninstallation
With my testing, it seems pretty safe to uninstall, however I would recommend that you unequip and flip over all of your cards before playing vanilla just to be safe.

# Known Issues
New cards do not appear in the run history screen. I'm not sure if I know how to fix it :( but I'll be looking at it.

Some of the cards do not have art yet, so enjoy the amazing stick people for now!

Random Chaos Trials cannot pull from the new deck right now, but fingers crossed I'll make the breakthrough on how to do it without having to override the base code!

If you find you are getting stuck often after using Monstrosity (doors won't open), you can enable AlwaysUnlockAfterPurge in the config, which will always unlock doors after collecting the purged reward. This includes when it shouldn't - for instance in Devotion chambers, or in the Fields of Mourning
# Thanks to:
@burn03 for their incredible art on the cards!! (Currently The Faithful Daughter, Performance, The Hydra, The Loyal Protector, Retribution, The Wanderer, The Strategist, Beauty, Longing, Companionship, Doom, Encouragement and Monstrosity).

@PunishedMat for the amazing art on Bounty!

# IMPORTANT INFORMATION :)
If you find any bugs, please let me know on the Hades Modding Discord (under requests, in Reversed Arcana of Ashes).

Also, any feedback on balancing would be appreciated (at the same place as bugs) as I kind of guessed without an excess of testing. If certain things are too underpowered or too overpowered (I aim for it to be around as good as the other side of the card), or if upgrade costs are too expensive, let me know!

If you are interested in making art for the cards, feel free to help out - @burn03 has made an awesome template on the Hades Modding Discord (pinned under requests, in Reversed Arcana of Ashes). It would be so awesome if you did so :)
