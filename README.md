# The Problem
We've only got 25 arcana cards to use, meaning only around 500,000 combinations if you could freely select them. We're practically so limited in options :(


# The Solution
Every card can now be flipped into a whole new card with new upgrades to unlock! This explodes the possible number of combinations you can try, with them designed for different synergies, uses and builds. Unlock the full power of your arcana with familiar faces, ranging from Hypnos, to Dusa, to Typhon, your familiars and even Lernie the Bone Hydra!

# How do I access the new arcana?
After unlocking every familiar and gaining the ability to upgrade your arcana, you will learn a new incantation. This will enable you to flip cards. After you do perform the incantation in the Cauldron, use the same button you use to pin things to flip your cards (which will have the side effect of also pinning whatever card you are clicking).

# Compatibility
No known compatibility issues. If you have Zagreus's Journey installed (Hades 1 run), the cards will require resources from that route in order to unlock and upgrade, giving you a real reason to take that route. 

In addition, if Extended Altar of Ashes is installed, you will get additional levels for these cards! 

# Uninstallation
With my testing, it seems pretty safe to uninstall, however I would recommend that you unequip and flip over all of your cards before playing vanilla just to be safe.

# Known Issues
Some of the auto-equipping arcana may flip back to the original card when you open the altar of ashes. If you do open the altar before leaving the Crossroads, make sure you check the cards are the version you want to equip. If you don't touch the altar, you should have no issues.

New cards also do not appear in the run history screen. I'm not sure if I know how to fix it :( but I'll be looking at it.

Some of the cards do not have art yet, so enjoy Hades staring at you and judging you for installing mods.

Random Chaos Trials cannot pull from the new deck right now, but fingers crossed I'll make the breakthrough on how to do it without breaking the game!
