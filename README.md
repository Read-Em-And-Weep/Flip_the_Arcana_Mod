# The Problem
We've only got 25 arcana cards to use, meaning only around 500,000 combinations if you could freely select them. We're practically so limited in options :(


# The Solution
Every card can now be flipped into a whole new card with new upgrades to unlock! This explodes the possible number of combinations you can try, with them designed for different synergies, uses and builds. Unlock the full power of your arcana with familiar faces, ranging from Hypnos, to Dusa, to Typhon, your familiars and even Lernie the Bone Hydra!

# How do I access the new arcana?
After unlocking every familiar and gaining the ability to upgrade your arcana, you will gain access to a incantation that you can use to unlock the ability to flip cards. After you do it, use the same button you use to pin things to flip your cards.

# Known Issues
Some of the auto-equipping arcana may flip back to the original card when you open the altar of ashes, so if you do, make sure you check they are the version of the card you want to equip. If you don't touch the altar, you should have no issues.

New cards also do not appear in the run history screen. I'm not sure if I know how to fix it :( but I'll be looking

Some of the cards do not have art yet, so enjoy the early days of Hades staring at you and judging you for installing mods

Coming soon: config option for Extended Altar of Ashes mod, so that you can upgrade these to your heart's content!
