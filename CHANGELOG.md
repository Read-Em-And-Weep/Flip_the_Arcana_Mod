## [1.2.1] - 2025-12-04

### Changes made

- Sleep (Hypnos) now is only active in guardian encounters and only while standing still. Time between heals has been shortened to compensate for this. If it is still too strong (not counting the legendary upgrade with Extended Altar of Ashes), please let me know.
- Legendary Upgrade of Sleep (Hypnos) in Extended Altar of Ashes removed, since it is far too strong.
- Terrible MS Paint art has been added for cards up until The Cyclops (Polyphemus). If it looks bad, assume I did it. Otherwise, all credit goes to @burn03

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-04

### Fixed

- Hermes no longer has a vandetta against you playing the game and will not cause you to crash (hopefully)

### Balance Changes

- Blacksmith (Hepheastus) has been nerfed, and will now only activate for damage above 20. Maybe the Messager can finally be used over it and Hermes will stopping being mad
- Beauty (Aphrodite) has been nerfed to have 3/6/9/12% dodge chance instead of starting at 4%
- Sleep (Hypnos) has been nerfed to only heal you in guardian encounters
