## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.1] - 2025-12-14

- Fixed LootChoiceExtender Crash (I think), thanks @zerp
- Cards which call a function when being drawn (such as the Boatman) will now actually perform their function (oops!) when picked from Monstrosity
- This mod no longer caps your natural god count at 2 (Typhon was so hungry for boons, he was even eating that slot)

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-12

- New animation for Monstrosity loot drop (Thank you @burn03 for the animation and @zerp for implementing it!)

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-12

Major Changes

- Monstrosity (Typhon) has been completely reworked to allow you to purge rewards to create a new loot type which rewards you with your choice of one of three unequipped arcana cards
- CONTROLLER PLAYERS REJOICE! Now you can flip cards using the reroll button without opening your themes tab.
- New art for Bounty (Poseidon). Thanks @PunishedMat! :)

Minor Changes

    - Bounty (Poseidon) has been buffed to offer more rarify uses
    - Gorgon (Dusa) buffed to reduce damage further

## [1.4.6] - 2025-12-06

## [1.4.3] - 2025-12-06

- Fixed an issue that meant you could not view pinned cards in the inventory

## [1.4.2] - 2025-12-06

- Fixed an error where the longing (Echo and Narcissus) to level up an extra trait was so great that it caused a crash

## [1.4.1] - 2025-12-05

- Fixed an error that targeted NikkelM specifically

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-05

- Minor grammar and tooltip fixes
- Fixed issue with visibility of glow for flipped card

### New Art

- Companionship (Familiars), Hydra (Lernie), Retribution (Nemesis), Encouragement (Supportive Shade), has been added
- Slight variations made to previous cards

## [1.3.1] - 2025-12-05

### Changes

- Grammar fix on Strategist
- The cool new glow is now inactive for flipped cards if not equipped when they are first created/screen is first opened

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-05

### Balance Changes made

- Sleep (Hypnos) reverted to previous status of always being active in guardian encounters! Hypnos is always with you :)
- The Strategist (Athena) has been improved, and now offers half of its benefit towards enemies with only a single status condition
- Retribution has been changed to reflect
- Revelry has been slightly buffed to activate more often
- Doom has been slightly nerfed
- New card glow colour for flipped cards! It's a more purple-blue to the original's green-blue. Subtle, but noticeable difference
- Terrible MS Paint art added for all cards!! 

## [1.2.1] - 2025-12-04

### Changes made

- Sleep (Hypnos) now is only active in guardian encounters and only while standing still. Time between heals has been shortened to compensate for this. If it is still too strong (not counting the legendary upgrade with Extended Altar of Ashes), please let me know.
- Legendary Upgrade of Sleep (Hypnos) in Extended Altar of Ashes removed, since it is far too strong.
- Terrible MS Paint art has been added for cards up until The Cyclops (Polyphemus). If it looks bad, assume I did it. Otherwise, all credit goes to @burn03

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-04

### Fixed

- Hermes no longer has a vandetta against you playing the game and will not cause you to crash (hopefully)

### Balance Changes

- Blacksmith (Hepheastus) has been nerfed, and will now only activate for damage above 20. Maybe the Messager can finally be used over it and Hermes will stop being mad
- Beauty (Aphrodite) has been nerfed to have 3/6/9/12% dodge chance instead of starting at 4%
- Sleep (Hypnos) has been nerfed to only heal you in guardian encounters

## [1.0.0]

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-03
